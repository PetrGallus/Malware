# Ai & Malware analysis

## Outline

* Malware research and AI
* What will we learn
* AI applications in malware research
* executable features (information sources, augemented features, comparison of static and dynamic features)
* models can be used for classification

## AI - Introduction

* It is just good old statistics with enough computing power now
* can AI solve undecidable problems?&#x20;
  * &#x20;it is still an algorithm
  * The computer virus detection problem is undecidable (Cohen, 1987)
* Do we need to use AI?
  * not at all
  * provides mathematical tools
  * helps to solve some nonlinear optimization problems (computer visions)
  * BUT traditional algorithms can be BETTER (in malware analyses)
    * FALSE-POSITIVE using AI is HIGHER
    * so is it useful at all?

## What will we learn?

* How can we use AI tools in malware research
* evaluating anti-malware products and projects

## Fundamentals

* Most AI and ML systems that we can see
  * lear from past experiences
  * supervised modelus
  * lear features (Bengio)
* Measuring performance
  * using both for evaluation and training the model
  * statistical tests
  * info-theoretic measurements
  * data validaton
  * clustering

### AI applications

* Mostly malware classification
  * malware families
  * malicious or benign
  * behaviour anomaly detection
* Main info sources
  * executable file
  * system and API calls
  * network traffic

### Feature engineering

* 4-gram byte
* single byte freq
* instruction count
* function name
* derived assembly feature
* "Golden features"
  * opcode count 2-gram, 3-gram, 4-gram
  * header count
  * asm pixel intensity
* two different approaches for that
  * .asm file
  * .bytes file

### Features

* Executable
  * Header (sections, dynamic libs, APIs used)
  * Assembly instructions, opcodes
  * constants - strings
  * debug info
* augmented features
  * CFG - function call graph
  * compiler and linker info
  * statistical and info-theoretic properties

AI Engineering

* Models, algorithms
  * mathematical way to express and categorize data
  * ML classifiers
* SVM
  * high (p-) dimension feature space divided by p-1 dimensional hyperplane (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995)
* ANN
  * feed-forward back propagation multi.layer perceptron

## Conclusion

* Unsupervised NN
  * identifying malicious payloads (Baptista 2019)
  * measuring similarity between programs
* Control flow graph similarity
  * polymorphic viruses
  * graph isomorphisn
  * automatic signature generation
