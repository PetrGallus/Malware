# Ai & Malware analysis

## Outline

* Malware research and AI
* What will we learn
* AI applications in malware research
* executable features (information sources, augemented features, comparison of static and dynamic features)
* models can be used for classification

## AI - Introduction

* It is just good old statistics with enough computing power now
* can AI solve undecidable problems?&#x20;
  * &#x20;it is still an algorithm
  * The computer virus detection problem is undecidable (Cohen, 1987)
* Do we need to use AI?
  * not at all
  * provides mathematical tools
  * helps to solve some nonlinear optimization problems (computer visions)
  * BUT traditional algorithms can be BETTER (in malware analyses)
    * FALSE-POSITIVE using AI is HIGHER
    * so is it useful at all?
